## Project Overview

**MedLab Diagnostics**, a biomedical facility in Kumasi, Ghana, needed actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and patient retention. Using Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project uncovered usage trends, patient behavior, and time-based bottlenecks that were slowing growth.

> The goal? Transform raw healthcare data into crystal-clear insights that spark better decisions.

---

## Key Objectives

- Identify **high-performing** and **underutilized** diagnostic tests.
- Compare **new vs returning patient trends**.
- Pinpoint **peak vs off-peak congestion** to optimize staffing.
- Recommend **revenue-boosting strategies** using data.

---

## Tools & Tech Stack

- **Python** – pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Jupyter Notebook** – end-to-end analysis and visual storytelling
- **Excel** – initial data source

---


## Deliverables

- Cleaned dataset and reproducible Python scripts
- EDA visualizations highlighting trends and inefficiencies
- Business Case Presentation (PDF with recommendations)

---

## Key Findings

- Underutilized tests present revenue growth opportunities.
- Returning patient rates were **lower than expected**—signaling a retention gap.
- Peak hours revealed operational congestion needing smarter scheduling.


---

## Recommendations

1. Introduce a **digital appointment scheduler** to flatten peak congestion.
2. Launch **patient loyalty programs** to improve retention.
3. Bundle underutilized tests into promotional packages.
4. Leverage insights to align **staffing with traffic patterns**.
